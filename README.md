Checkout my project on T20 World Cup Data Analysis. First of all used  selenium for webscraping, pandas for reading csv, grouping, filtering, label encoding, etc and plotly for visualization. I have divided Visualization as All time records, Season wise Records), Records in Knockout &amp; Final, First &amp; Last 3 season records and Indian  Cricket Team records, further sub-divided into Most Runs, Most 6s, 4s, 50s, catches, etc.
